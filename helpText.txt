This is a node.js console configured with the aquila-client library.
You can use any of the library's command for monitoring and interfacing with the Aquila network.

Example uses:

        Get all devices:
                things = aq.devices();
        Filter by name:
                things = aq.devices("#Device Name");
        Filter by class:
                things = aq.devices(".mx.makerlab.deviceClass");
        Filter by address:
                things = aq.devices([252,194,61,0,0,5,178,228]);
        Filter by id:
                things = aq.devices("544987f20e027eb259a88a6f");

        Execute action by number:
                things.action(0);
        Execute action by name, with param 255:
                things.action("Turn On", 255);

        Subscribe function to an event:
                things.on("Button Pressed", function(param) {
                        console.log("Got event 'Button Pressed' with param ", param);
                    });

        Discover nearby devices:
                aq.discover();

        Reload all devices:
                aq.reload();

        Get PAN
                aq.getPAN(function(err, pan){
                        console.log(pan);
                    });

        Set PAN
                var newPAN = 0xCA5A;
                aq.setPAN(newPAN, function(err, pan) {
                        if(err) console.log("Error setting PAN");
                        console.log("PAN set OK and is now: ", pan);
                    });
